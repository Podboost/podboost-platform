# Demo Access Removed

## Changes Made:
1. **Removed Demo Access Section**: Eliminated the "Want to Try Before You Buy?" section with free trial and demo access buttons
2. **Removed JavaScript Functions**: Deleted `startFreeTrial()` and `grantDemoAccess()` functions
3. **Clean Premium Page**: Now only shows paid Premium subscription option

## Result:
- Users can only access premium features through paid $7/month subscription
- No more free trials or demo access bypassing payment
- Professional subscription-only experience
- Clean, focused premium signup page

Upload the updated `premium-signup.html` to remove demo access completely.
