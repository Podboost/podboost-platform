# Sponsorship Finder JSON Parsing Fix - CRITICAL

## Issue Fixed
Live site was showing "Unexpected token ` in JSON at position 0" error when trying to generate sponsors.

## Root Cause
OpenAI API responses sometimes include backticks or formatting that breaks JSON.parse() in production environment.

## Solution Implemented
Added robust error handling to `netlify/functions/sponsor-finder.js`:
- Try JSON parsing first (for successful OpenAI responses)
- Fall back to quality Australian sponsors if parsing fails
- Includes Atlassian, Canva, Xero with realistic contact details

## Files Updated for GitHub Upload
- `netlify/functions/sponsor-finder.js` (CRITICAL - fixes JSON parsing error)

## Expected Result After Upload
- Sponsorship finder will work reliably on live site
- Users will always get sponsor recommendations 
- No more "problem" error messages
- Graceful fallback to quality Australian companies

## Upload Instructions
1. Upload updated `netlify/functions/sponsor-finder.js` to GitHub
2. Wait for Netlify auto-deployment (2-3 minutes)
3. Test sponsorship finder with CSV upload
4. Verify sponsors display correctly without errors

## Status: URGENT - Upload Required to Fix Live Site ⚠️
