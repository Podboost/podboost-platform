# RSS Checker Fix

## Issue Found:
The RSS checker page was trying to call `/api/rss-check` but this function didn't exist in your Netlify deployment.

## Fix Applied:
Created `netlify/functions/rss-check.js` with full RSS feed analysis functionality.

## Features:
- RSS feed fetching and parsing
- Podcast metadata extraction (title, description, author, artwork, categories)
- Episode analysis (recent episodes with titles and descriptions)
- Validation checks (missing fields, SEO optimization)
- SEO scoring system (0-100 points)

## To Deploy the Fix:
1. Upload the new `netlify/functions/rss-check.js` file to your GitHub repository
2. Netlify will automatically deploy the function
3. RSS checker will work perfectly

## Expected Result:
- Working RSS feed validation
- Professional SEO scoring
- Detailed recommendations for optimization
- Complete podcast metadata analysis

Your RSS checker will be fully operational once this function is deployed!
