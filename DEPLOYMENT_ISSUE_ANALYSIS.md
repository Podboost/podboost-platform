# Live Site Deployment Issue Analysis

## Current Status
✅ **Files Uploaded:** Both sponsor-finder.js and rss-check.js uploaded to GitHub
✅ **Functions Accessible:** HTTP 405 responses confirm functions exist and are deployed
❌ **Execution:** Both functions timeout (504) when called with actual requests

## Possible Causes

### 1. Netlify Build Cache
- Old functions may still be cached
- New uploaded functions not deployed yet
- **Solution:** Force rebuild or clear cache

### 2. OpenAI API Key Issues
- Environment variable not properly set in Netlify
- API key format/encoding issues
- **Solution:** Re-verify OPENAI_API_KEY in Netlify dashboard

### 3. Netlify Function Timeout
- Default timeout might be too short for OpenAI calls
- **Solution:** Optimize function or increase timeout

### 4. Cold Start Performance
- First calls to serverless functions take longer
- **Solution:** Wait for functions to warm up

## Evidence
- Functions return proper CORS headers (they're deployed)
- OPTIONS requests work (CORS preflight succeeds)
- POST requests timeout completely (execution issue)

## Recommendation
1. Check Netlify deploy logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for full deployment
4. Test again with simpler requests

## Next Steps
Monitor deployment and test periodically for successful execution.
