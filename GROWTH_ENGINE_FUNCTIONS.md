# Growth Engine Functions - CRITICAL MISSING APIs

## Problem Identified
Your live site is missing the Growth Engine API endpoints that work perfectly in Replit.

## Missing Functions from Live Site:
1. `/api/analyze-rss-growth` - RSS-based growth analysis
2. `/api/analyze-csv-growth` - CSV file growth analysis

## Replit vs Live Site Gap:
- **Replit:** Has working growth engine endpoints at lines 4192-4650 in simple-server.js
- **Live Site:** Missing these endpoints completely
- **Result:** Growth engine appears broken to users

## Created Netlify Functions:
✅ `netlify/functions/analyze-rss-growth.js` - RSS growth analysis with scoring
✅ `netlify/functions/analyze-csv-growth.js` - CSV data growth analysis

## What These Fix:
- **RSS Growth Analysis:** Analyzes podcast feeds for growth potential, SEO recommendations
- **CSV Growth Analysis:** Analyzes episode data for performance insights and action items
- **Growth Scoring:** Provides 0-100 growth scores based on content metrics
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Specific tips for audience growth and content optimization

## CRITICAL: Upload These Files
Both functions are essential for Growth Engine functionality on your live site.

Upload to GitHub:
- `netlify/functions/analyze-rss-growth.js`
- `netlify/functions/analyze-csv-growth.js`

## Result After Upload:
Growth Engine will work exactly like in Replit with proper analysis and recommendations.
