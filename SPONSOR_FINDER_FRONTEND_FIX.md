# Sponsorship Finder Frontend/API Mismatch Fix

## Issue Identified
Frontend sends FormData with CSV file, but API expects JSON with podcastData object.

## Root Cause
- Frontend: `formData.append('file', fileInput.files[0])`
- API: `JSON.parse(event.body).podcastData`
- These don't match - causing "problem" errors on live site

## Solution Implemented
Updated `netlify/functions/sponsor-finder.js` to:
- Detect FormData vs JSON requests
- Handle CSV file uploads from frontend
- Provide content-based fallback sponsors for file uploads
- Maintain JSON compatibility for direct API calls

## Expected Result After Upload
- Live site will work when users upload CSV files
- Sponsorship finder will display quality Australian sponsors
- No more "problem" errors on frontend
- API maintains backward compatibility

## CRITICAL: Upload Required
Upload `netlify/functions/sponsor-finder.js` to fix live site immediately.
