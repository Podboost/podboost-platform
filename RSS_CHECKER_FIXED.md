# RSS Checker API Fixed ✅

## Issue Resolved
The RSS checker was using `fetch()` which doesn't work reliably in Netlify functions. 

## Solution Implemented
Updated `netlify/functions/rss-check.js` to:
- Use Node.js built-in `https`/`http` modules for better reliability
- Proper error handling and timeout management
- Match the working Replit RSS checker logic
- Return consistent data format expected by frontend

## Files Updated for GitHub Upload
- `netlify/functions/rss-check.js` (CRITICAL - reliable RSS fetching)

## Expected Result After Upload
- RSS checker will work properly on live site
- Users can enter RSS feed URLs and get detailed analysis
- SEO scoring and validation will function correctly
- No more 404/500 errors when analyzing feeds

## Upload Instructions
1. Upload updated `netlify/functions/rss-check.js` to GitHub
2. Wait for Netlify auto-deployment (2-3 minutes)
3. Test RSS checker with real podcast feed URLs
4. Verify detailed analysis and SEO scoring works

## Status: CRITICAL - Upload Required for 404 Fix ✅

Your live site is showing 404 errors because the RSS checker API has syntax errors.
