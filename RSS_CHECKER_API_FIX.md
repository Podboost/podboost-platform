# RSS Checker API Fix Required

## Issue Identified
The RSS checker API on live site is returning errors when trying to fetch RSS feeds.

## Error Details
- API endpoint exists: /.netlify/functions/rss-check
- But returns: "Failed to fetch RSS feed: HTTP 404"
- This suggests the RSS fetching logic needs to be updated

## Files to Check/Update
1. `netlify/functions/rss-check.js` - May need HTTPS/CORS fixes
2. RSS checker frontend might need endpoint URL updates

## Next Steps
1. Review rss-check.js function implementation
2. Update with proper RSS fetching logic from working Replit version
3. Test with valid RSS feed URLs
4. Deploy updated function to GitHub

## Status
- RSS checker page loads correctly
- API endpoint exists but has fetching issues
- Need to sync working Replit RSS logic to Netlify function
