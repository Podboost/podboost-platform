# Demo Access Removal Verification

## Current Status:
- ✅ **Replit File**: Demo access removed from `github-complete-deployment/premium-signup.html`
- ❌ **Live Site**: Still showing demo access (not uploaded yet)

## How to Verify the Correct File:

### 1. Check the Updated File in Replit:
- File path: `github-complete-deployment/premium-signup.html`
- Look for line 157: Should show `</div>` (empty space where demo was)
- Should NOT contain: "Want to Try Before You Buy?"
- Should NOT contain: "Start Free Trial" or "Demo Access" buttons

### 2. What You Should See in the File:
```html
            </div>
        </div>

    </div>
    <!-- No demo section here anymore -->
```

### 3. After Upload to GitHub:
The live site will show only:
- Free Plan ($0/month)
- Premium Plan ($7/month) 
- Single "Upgrade to Premium" button
- NO demo access section

## Quick Check:
Search the file for "Demo" - you should find ZERO results.
