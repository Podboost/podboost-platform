# Sponsor Personalization Fix

## Issue:
The AI sponsor finder was showing the same generic Australian companies (Afterpay, Canva, Woolworths) regardless of podcast content.

## Root Cause:
- Generic system prompt that always suggested the same companies
- No analysis of specific podcast content, topics, or audience
- Temperature too low (0.7) causing repetitive results

## Fix Applied:
1. **Enhanced AI Prompt**: Now analyzes specific podcast content and themes
2. **Content-Based Matching**: Generates sponsors relevant to podcast topics:
   - Tech podcasts → Software companies, developer tools
   - Health podcasts → Fitness brands, supplements, wellness apps  
   - Business podcasts → Business services, financial services
   - Comedy podcasts → Entertainment brands, lifestyle products
3. **Balanced Mix**: 40% topic-relevant + 30% Australian + 30% global brands
4. **Higher Temperature**: Increased to 0.8 for more variety
5. **Better Context**: AI now analyzes podcast data for personalized matching

## Result:
- Tech podcasts will get software and SaaS sponsors
- Health podcasts will get fitness and wellness sponsors
- Comedy podcasts will get entertainment and lifestyle sponsors
- Each podcast gets truly personalized sponsor recommendations
